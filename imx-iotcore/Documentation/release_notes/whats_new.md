BSP change history
====
This chapter lists changes in releases, including new features and defect fixes.

## 4/2020 : W1.1.0
Production release for i.MX6, i.MX7 and i.MX8M platform.
  - New:
      - Supported boards:
        :   The existing BSP ported to additional i.MX8MN NXP board.
      - USB driver:
        :   Added UcmTcpciCx Port Controller Client Driver for iMX8MQ-EVK. i.MX8MQ-EVK has support for runtime change of the USB Type-C plug orientation.
      - Default application:
        :   The Arm64DefaultApp, prebuilt Windows 10 IoT Core Default App for ARM64 devices and the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) runs upon startup on supported i.MX8 devices.

  - Fixes:
      - PWM driver:
        :   Fixed PWM timing calculation for current input clock source.
      - BootLoader:
        :   imx-mkimage compilation error fixed by adding MKIMAGE_COMMIT to sources.
      - Generated BSP:
        :   Deployment of files into BSP directory by GenerateBSP fixed by adding files necessary for imxdod (all i.MX8), Arm64CrtRuntime (all i.MX8), BSP.svupdateOS.wm.xml (Sabre_iMX7D_1GB), NXPEVK_iMX8M_Mini_2GB.
      - WinPe:
        :   Added make-WinPE scripts for i.MX 6Qx subfamily.
      - i.MX6ULL boot issue:
        :   Initialization of CAAM module has been removed from optee_os_arm for i.MX6ULL MCU (i.MX6ULL doesn't have CAAM module).
      - imxnetmini driver:
        :   Multicast address hash table register GAUR setting fixed. All boards can obtain IPv6 address.

  - Improvements:
      - TA:
        :   Updated MSRSec containing OP-TEE Trusted Applications.
      - BootLoader:
        :   Updated imx-mkimage submodule to revision d7f9440d.
      - WinPe:
        :   Script now handles paths containing spaces.
      - PWM driver:
        :   Added initialization of the PWM clocks in UEFI across all supported boards.
      - Release distribution:
        :   Unnecessary log files have been removed from release.
      - Clock subsystem:
        :   Changes done to clock signal routing.

          - Set higher CPU clock frequency to MCIMX6UL-EVK board. Cortex-A7 core is running on 528/696MHz according the chip version: Vx05/Vx07 MCUs (chip version detected from FUSEs).
          - Set higher CPU clock frequency to MCIMX6ULL-EVK board. Cortex-A7 core is running on 528/792/900MHz according to the chip version: Vx05/08/09 MCUs (chip version detected from FUSEs).
          - Bypassed CCM in CPU clock path on MCIMX8M-EVK board. CPU core clock is routed directly from ARM PLL. CCM clock is still limited to 1GHz max.

## 10/2019 : W1.0.0
Initial engineering release for i.MX6, i.MX7 and i.MX8M platform.
  - New:
      - Supported boards:
        :   The existing BSP from Microsoft ported to additional i.MX6, i.MX7 and i.MX8M NXP boards.
      - Audio driver:
        :   WM8960 audio codec driver supported.
      - VPU driver:
        :   Video processing unit enabled for i.MX8M_4GB and i.MX8M_Mini_2GB boards.

  - Improvements:
      - Ethernet driver:
        :   Ethernet PHY configuration data moved from the driver code (mp_enet_phy.c) to the ENET ACPI table (_DSD in Dsdt-Network.asl).
