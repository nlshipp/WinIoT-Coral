Windows 10 IoT Video Processing Unit on i.MX Platform {#vpu}
==============

This chapter describes the Video Processing Unit on i.MX8 Quad and i.MX8 Mini.

## Features
   * HW Support of playback video clips encoded with h264 and h265 codec.
   * Media Transport Foundation API supported.

## Limitations
   * GPU operations such as resize/scale/crop etc. don't have HW support. These
     operations are computed by CPU and may cause high CPU load and playback may be very slow.
     Thus, delivered IoTCore Media Player has disabled scaling by default. However clips having
     different  video resolution and buffer dimensions force scale operation in VPU driver,
     that may also cause high CPU load. Progressive clips also require crop operation.
     This limitation will be resolved by implementation of GPU driver.
