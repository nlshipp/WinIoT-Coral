/**
  Rotates a 64-bit integer left between 0 and 63 bits, filling
  the low bits with the high bits that were rotated.

  This function rotates the 64-bit value Operand to the left by Count bits. The
  low Count bits are fill with the high Count bits of Operand. The rotated
  value is returned.

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to rotate left.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to rotate left.

  @return Operand <<< Count
